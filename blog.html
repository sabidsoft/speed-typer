                            Local storage is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">
                            In local storage, the stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed. In session storage, the data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed.
                        </li>
                        <li class="list">
                            In local storage, the data is stored on the browser and system. In session storage, the data is stored on the browser only.

                            Variables declared Globally have Global Scope. Variables declared within a JavaScript curly braces { } become block scope (without var keyword).

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function stack becomes empty.The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is single-threaded. Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises. The event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.

                            When we declare a variable and don't initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined.
